# Interview_Analysis_57AD

This project aims to generate a confidence score through the use of deep
learning to assess a candidate’s performance during a virtual interview pro-
cess. The proposed work consists of an emotion detection module that clas-
sifies emotion based on images, nervousness from gaze detection and blink
rate, all of which are fed to a confidence measure that can efficiently assess a
candidate’s performance. After a cumulative assessment of these features, a
confidence score is generated for each candidate. The interviewer could use
this as a differentiating factor between candidates, to ensure that they recruit
the best candidates for their organization. The work is done on Google colab
with Python 3 and OpenCV libraries
